## 1. What does this project do?

**LabsBakery** turns lab‚Äëbuilding into a three‚Äëstep recipe:

1. **Drag** virtual machines (Windows, Kali, Ubuntu‚Ä¶) onto a canvas.
2. **Draw** cables to show who talks to whom.
3. **Bake** ‚Äî the app writes a *tiny* text file (`Vagrantfile`‚ÄØ+‚ÄØ`project.json`).  Share that file and anyone can run `vagrant up` to pull the images and spin the *exact same* lab.

Kilobytes shared, gigabytes downloaded on demand.  No disk shipping, no manual setup.

## 2. Why is this project useful?

I built LabsBakery as my **final‚Äëyear university project** because creating practice labs was the #1 pain in my own cyber‚Äësecurity journey:

| Old pain                                                  | LabsBakery cure                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Huge ISO downloads** for every assignment               | Re‚Äëuse cached cloud images                             |
| **Re‚Äëcreating VMs** again and again                       | Save a recipe, rebuild with one command                |
| **Costly cloud labs** (hard on a Moroccan student budget) | Run everything locally for free                        |
| **Sharing labs with classmates** was a mess               | Send one recipe file; teammates get an identical setup |
